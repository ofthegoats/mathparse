* Description

Mathparse is a small program written in Haskell for parsing mathematical expressions into
different forms.

It is (read: will be, eventually, maybe), capable of converting expressions into RPN, an AST, and
evaluating them.

** Current State

- [X] infix -> RPN
- [ ] infix -> AST
- [ ] evaluation

Currently, it is also only run through =ghci main.hs=

** Why would you do this?

It sounded fun. /Maybe/ someone will turn out to have a use for it besides.
